    Yeah, this is gonna be hard to explain properly. To start, I didn't really understand what I was doing at first.
    The way I understand it, display: grid is just one of those things you need, well, a grid, I mean.
    Then the colums and rows. I think you just put auto for the amount you want, meaning auto auto auto gives 3 columns. [I changed it after making this comment :3]
    The gap just creates some space between the boxes in the grid. [I have no idea if this even does anything, honestly]
    Align-content: center just puts the grid in the center of the page. I'm unsure if this one actually works.

    Position: fixed puts the grid into the text. Well underneath the text, like right below it. It merges the formatting. Other words for make it look good.
    This was a lie. This one line of code made it look garbage, so I removed it. Well, kept it, just commented it. See the process, learn from it.

    Width: 100vh just makes it as wide as the view, the page. [This also has been changed, it extended the page slightly. Probably had to do with the gap (it did not)]

/*
    These are simpler, the grid-row just says it takes the full row. Rows are horizontal, so it works. Just trust me on this.
    Grid-column I actually have to explain. 1/1 means it takes up 1 through 1, so only the first. 2/2 works the exact same, it takes only the second slot an so on.
    Text-align: center makes the text go middle of grid block.
