    Adding grids into the mix
*/


/*
    Yeah, this is gonna be hard to explain properly. To start, I didn't really understand what I was doing at first.
    The way I understand it, display: grid is just one of those things you need, well, a grid, I mean.
    Then the colums and rows. I think you just put auto for the amount you want, meaning auto auto auto gives 3 columns.
    The gap just creates some space between the boxes in the grid.
    Align-content: center just puts the grid in the center of the page. I'm unsure if this one actually works.
    Position: fixed puts the grid into the text. Well underneath the text, like right below it. It merges the formatting. Other words for make it look good.
    Width: 100vh just makes it as wide as the view, the page.

#grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: auto auto auto;
    grid-template-rows: auto;
    gap: 15px;
    align-content: center;
    position: fixed;
    width: 100vw;
}

#midWeek {
    grid-column: 1/1;
    grid-row: 1/1;
    text-align: center;
}

#weekEnd {
    grid-column: 2/2;
    grid-row: 1/1;
    text-align: center;
}

#closed {
    grid-column: 3/3;
    grid-row: 1/1;
    text-align: center;
}
